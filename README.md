#### Wrangler

Before publishing your code you need to edit `wrangler.toml` file and add your Cloudflare `account_id` - more information about configuring and publishing your code can be found [in the documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/getting-started#7-configure-your-project-for-deployment).

Once you are ready, you can publish your code by running the following command:

```
npx wrangler publish
```
